# Career Journey

## Before Mantel

Prior to joining Mantel, I held leadership roles that shaped my approach to technical delivery:

### QA Manager

Built and managed a QA team, establishing testing standards and processes. Responsible for performance management and developing team members. This role taught me how to set clear expectations, hold people accountable, and create an environment where quality was everyone's responsibility.

### Platform Lead

Led a platform engineering team, owning technical direction and architecture decisions. Delegated effectively by providing context, tools, timelines, and expected results. Learned that enabling others to succeed is more valuable than being the hero who does everything.

These roles gave me hands-on experience with the leadership aspects of the Lead Engineer role before I joined Mantel.
