# Career Journey

## Before Mantel

Prior to joining Mantel, I held leadership roles that shaped my approach to technical delivery.

### QA Manager

Built and managed a QA team, establishing testing standards and processes. Responsible for performance management and developing team members. This role taught me how to set clear expectations, hold people accountable, and create an environment where quality was everyone's responsibility.

### Platform Lead

Led a platform engineering team, owning technical direction and architecture decisions. Learned to delegate by providing context, the right tools, clear timelines, and expected outcomes. This is where I realised that enabling others to succeed is more valuable than being the one who does everything.

## At Mantel (September 2021 – Present)

### Senior Software Engineer (2023 – Present)

**NAB — Enterprise AI Self-Service Platform (Oct 2025 – Jan 2026)**

Designed a self-service framework for AI adoption so teams could build and deploy Bedrock AgentCore applications without waiting on the platform team. Aligned with existing Terraform and Jenkins patterns to make it easy for other teams to pick up. Completed a 70+ page AI security review to get the project approved.

**Wesfarmers (One Digital) — AWS Bedrock AgentCore PoC (Aug 2025 – Sep 2025)**

Large-scale migration of TAB NZ's in-store gaming terminals. Built full-stack retail services including backend APIs (Golang, protobuf RPC), REST APIs, and an internal admin portal (Vue.js). Worked closely with the client development manager throughout, which led to an invitation for our team to join their celebration dinner in Brisbane.

**Entain — Broadcast Partner Feed: API Uplift (Feb 2024 – Jul 2025)**

Assessed a legacy REST API and recommended a refactoring approach over a GraphQL rewrite. Gained stakeholder buy-in, then led a team of three additional Mantel developers to complete the work. Introduced dependency injection, testing patterns, and observability (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo). Increased unit test coverage from 0% to 75%.
