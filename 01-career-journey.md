# Career Journey

> Background and experience across leadership, engineering, and delivery
> roles.

## Before Mantel

Prior to joining Mantel, I held leadership roles that shaped my approach to
technical delivery.

### Platform Lead

Led a platform engineering team, owning technical direction and architecture
decisions. Learned to delegate by providing context, the right tools, clear
timelines, and expected outcomes. This is where I realised that enabling others
to succeed is more valuable than being the one who does everything.

### QA Manager

Built and managed a QA team, establishing testing standards and processes.
Responsible for performance management and developing team members. This role
taught me how to set clear expectations, hold people accountable, and create an
environment where quality was everyone's responsibility.

## At Mantel (September 2021 – Present)

### Senior Software Engineer (2023 – Present)

#### NAB — Enterprise AI Self-Service Platform (Oct 2025 – Jan 2026)

Designed a self-service framework for AI adoption so teams could build and
deploy Bedrock AgentCore applications without waiting on the platform team.
Aligned with existing Terraform and Jenkins patterns to make it easy for other
teams to pick up. Completed a 70+ page AI security review to get the project
approved.

#### Wesfarmers (One Digital) — AWS Bedrock AgentCore PoC (Aug 2025 – Sep 2025)

Six-week rapid prototype, sponsored by AWS. Built a chatbot for business queries
and a specialised agent for generating proposal documents. Integrated with
Slack, Confluence, and SharePoint. Presented the solution architecture to
stakeholders and was invited back to present at the AWS Melbourne offices.

#### Entain — TAB NZ Retail Terminals (Feb 2024 – Jul 2025)

Large-scale migration of TAB NZ's in-store gaming terminals. Built full-stack
retail services including backend APIs (Golang, protobuf RPC), REST APIs, and an
internal admin portal (Vue.js).

#### Entain — Broadcast Partner Feed: API Uplift (Feb 2024 – Jul 2025)

Assessed a legacy REST API and recommended a refactoring approach over a GraphQL
rewrite. Gained stakeholder buy-in, then formed a team to complete the work.
Introduced dependency injection, testing patterns, and observability. Operated
in a Lead capacity throughout, owning technical direction and enabling the
team, without the explicit title.

### Senior Cloud Engineer (2021 – 2023)

Led enterprise GitHub migrations and established myself as a platform tooling
expert.

#### ANZ — GitHub Migration & Automation Services (May 2022 – Feb 2024)

High-stakes migration of thousands of repositories from legacy source control to
GitHub Enterprise. The bank's risk aversion required comprehensive tracking and
stakeholder visibility.

Designed and built an automated reporting bot that collated migration data and
presented it in graphs and tables via a web portal and Slack. This gave ANZ
technical leadership and GitHub account managers real-time visibility into
progress without manual effort. Also contributed to the GitHub Automation
Service, a Golang configuration management solution using concurrent processing
and caching to manage GitHub at enterprise scale.

#### ANZ — Bamboo to GitHub Actions Migration (May 2022 – Feb 2024)

Tasked with assessing the scope of migrating CI pipelines from Bamboo to GitHub
Actions. Analysis of the Bamboo database revealed hundreds of VMs running
deployment agents across the bank, with limited understanding of ownership or
purpose.

Built scripts integrating with internal systems to surface this information and
consolidated it into reports presented to ANZ technical leadership and GitHub
account managers. This gave the bank visibility they'd never had, enabled ~30%
of the VMs to be deprovisioned, and reduced the risk profile for the migration.

#### ANZ — Gearbox Situational Controls (May 2022 – Feb 2024)

Event-driven data validation using GCP Cloud Functions and Golang. Built CI/CD
with GitHub Actions and Terraform.

#### NSW Rural Fire Service — GitHub Migration (Mar 2022 – Apr 2022)

Collaborated with GitHub engineers to migrate source control to GitHub
Enterprise Cloud EMU with Azure AD integration.

#### Big W — Kubernetes Observability Uplift (Dec 2021 – Mar 2022)

Gap analysis on Kubernetes monitoring, implemented alerting with Prometheus and
dashboards with Grafana.
