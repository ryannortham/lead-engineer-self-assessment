# Continued Development

> Honest reflection on areas for continued growth.

## Growth Areas

### People Guide Role

Building on prior experience managing QA and platform teams, I've taken on a People Guide role at Mantel to continue developing my mentoring approach within the consulting context.

### Formal Delegation at Scale

While I have experience delegating within teams I manage directly, I'm working toward more explicit handovers and shared ownership across broader teams and organisational boundaries.

### Broader Influence

Seeking opportunities to drive cross-team and organisational impact beyond immediate project delivery.

## My Commitment

- Actively seeking mentoring opportunities through my People Guide role
- Documenting learnings, standards, and conventions for team enablement
- Building on existing strengths while addressing identified growth areas
- Ready to take full accountability for technical outcomes at the Lead level
- Committed to continued growth and enabling others to succeed
