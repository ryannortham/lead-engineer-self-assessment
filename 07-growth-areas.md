# Growth Areas

> Honest reflection on areas for continued growth.

---

## Public Speaking

I'm out of practice with presenting to larger groups. The last couple of times
I did it, adrenaline got the better of me. As a Lead, I should be more
comfortable presenting to teams and clients, so this is something I'm actively
working on.

## Internal Initiatives

I want to get more involved with initiatives beyond project delivery. I'm
currently working with a team to produce an internal Python training course.
This is a step toward contributing more broadly to Mantel and getting
comfortable with a more visible role.

## Broader Influence

Looking for opportunities to have impact beyond immediate project delivery. The
Python training course is one example, and I'm keeping an eye out for other
ways to contribute.

## Frontend and Mobile Development

I enjoy frontend and mobile work, particularly designing clean, attractive user
experiences. This is an area where I feel I have untapped potential. I'd like
to take on more frontend and mobile opportunities as they come up to build
these skills and become a more well-rounded full-stack developer.

## Summary

Being self-aware about growth areas is a strength. I'm not pretending I have
nothing to work on. These are genuine areas where I want to improve, and I'm
taking steps to address them.
