# Continued Development

> Honest reflection on areas for continued growth.

## Growth Areas

### Public Speaking

I'm out of practice with presenting to larger groups. The last couple of times I did it, adrenaline got the better of me. As a Lead, I should be more comfortable presenting to teams and clients, so this is something I'm actively working on.

### Internal Initiatives

I want to get more involved with initiatives beyond project delivery. I'm currently working with a team to produce an internal Python training course. This is a step toward contributing more broadly to Mantel and getting comfortable with a more visible role.

### Delegation at Scale

While I have experience delegating within teams I manage directly, I'm working toward more explicit handovers and shared ownership across broader teams and organisational boundaries.

### Broader Influence

Looking for opportunities to have impact beyond immediate project delivery. The Python training course is one example, and I'm keeping an eye out for other ways to contribute.

### Frontend and Mobile Development

I enjoy frontend and mobile work, particularly designing clean, attractive user experiences. This is an area where I feel I have untapped potential. I'd like to take on more frontend and mobile opportunities as they come up to build these skills and become a more well-rounded full-stack developer.

## My Approach

Being self-aware about growth areas is a strength. I'm not pretending I have nothing to work on. These are genuine areas where I want to improve, and I'm taking steps to address them.
