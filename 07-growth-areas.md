# Growth Areas

> Honest reflection on areas for continued growth.

## Public Speaking

I'm out of practice with presenting to larger groups. The last couple of times
I did it, adrenaline got the better of me. As a Lead, I should be more
comfortable presenting to teams and clients, so this is something I'm actively
working on.

## Internal Initiatives

I want to get more involved with initiatives beyond project delivery. I'm
currently working with a team to produce an internal Python training course.
This is a step toward contributing more broadly to Mantel and getting
comfortable with a more visible role.

## Broader Influence

Looking for opportunities to have impact beyond immediate project delivery. The
Python training course is one example, and I'm keeping an eye out for other
ways to contribute.

## Frontend Development

At Entain, I challenged myself by stepping out of my backend comfort zone and
taking on frontend work. I picked up the framework quickly and designed the
UX/UI for their internal administration portal. I found that I genuinely
enjoyed the visual design aspect of this type of programming, and discovered
strengths in this area I'd like to develop further.

## Mobile Development

I've been building a personal project:
[Scorecard](https://github.com/ryannortham/scorecard), a Flutter/Dart app for
AFL goal umpires to track game scores. I've really enjoyed the process of
designing clean, attractive UX. I'm currently releasing it on the Google Play
Store.
