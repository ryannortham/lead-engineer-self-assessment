## Evidence

### Keeping standups focused

Standups can easily drift into long discussions, frustrating people who just want to get on with their work.

I'm confident enough to speak up and encourage the team to stay on track. When I notice things going off topic, I'll gently steer us back to the core format: what I did, what I'm doing, blockers. I encourage parking deeper discussions for afterwards, where interested people can stay. I model this by keeping my own updates short.

This keeps standups efficient. People appreciate having their time respected while still having space for important conversations.

### Building team culture through regular engagement

As QA Manager and Platform Lead, I was responsible for creating an environment where team members felt supported and could raise issues without fear.

I ran regular 1:1s with each team member to discuss career progression, work through problems, and give them space to raise concerns. Held team meetings with project updates, shoutouts, and knowledge sharing. Made myself available and approachable.

Team members raised issues early rather than hiding problems. We built a culture where people looked out for each other.

### Facilitating retrospectives that lead to action

It's easy for retros to become venting sessions where the team forgets to think about how to improve things. I make sure we come up with concrete action items with delegated ownership, and that we revisit progress on these in subsequent retros.

I also vary the format to keep sessions fresh and draw out different perspectives. Picking the right format based on what's happened that sprint helps quieter team members contribute in ways that suit them.

### Letting team members own their solutions

When delegating, it's tempting to prescribe exactly how something should be done, especially when you already have an approach in mind.

I've learned to step back and let people propose their own solutions, even when different from what I would do. I'll point out risks I can see, but leave the final decision with them. I trust that they'll learn and iterate if the first attempt doesn't work.

This gives team members real ownership over their work rather than just following instructions. It often produces better outcomes than the approach I had in mind. When things don't work out, we learn together.

## Summary

Establishing technical charter is about creating an environment where teams do good work. Regular engagement, efficient meetings, retrospectives that drive action, and trusting people to own their solutions builds teams that deliver consistently.
