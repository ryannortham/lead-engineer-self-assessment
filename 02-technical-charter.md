## Evidence

### Built team culture through regular engagement and open communication

**Context:** As QA Manager and Platform Lead in previous roles, I was responsible for creating an environment where team members felt supported and safe to raise issues.

**What I did:** Established regular 1:1 catchups with each team member to discuss career progression, resolve team issues, and provide a safe space for concerns. Hosted team meetings with project updates, shoutouts for good work, and knowledge sharing sessions. Made myself approachable and available.

**Outcome:** Team members felt comfortable raising issues early rather than hiding problems. Created a culture where people looked out for each other and celebrated successes together.

### Facilitated retrospectives to drive continuous improvement

**Context:** Retrospectives can become stale if run the same way every time. Teams disengage when they feel the format is going through the motions.

**What I did:** Built a repertoire of retrospective formats to keep sessions engaging and draw out different perspectives – traffic light retros, 3 Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked), Start/Stop/Continue, Mad/Sad/Glad. Selected formats based on what resonated with each team and the specific context of the sprint.

**Outcome:** Teams stayed engaged in retrospectives and surfaced genuine improvements. The variety helped quieter team members contribute in different ways.

### Guided teams toward effective standups and meetings

**Context:** Stand-up meetings can easily go off on tangents and run long, reducing their value and frustrating team members.

**What I did:** When I observed standups drifting, I guided the team back to the core format: what I did yesterday, what I'm doing today, blockers. Encouraged parking deeper discussions until the end, where interested people could choose to stay. Modelled the behaviour myself by keeping my updates concise.

**Outcome:** Standups became efficient and focused. Team members appreciated having their time respected while still having space for important discussions.

### Empowered team members to own their solutions

**Context:** When delegating work, it's tempting to prescribe exactly how something should be done – especially when you have a clear idea of the approach.

**What I did:** Learned to step back and let team members propose their own solutions, even when different from how I would approach it. Highlighted risks I could see with their approach, but ultimately left the decision with them. Trusted that they would learn and iterate if the first attempt didn't work out.

**Outcome:** Team members felt ownership over their work rather than just following instructions. More often than not, they came back with solutions better than I would have expected. When things didn't work out, we learned together and iterated.

## Summary

Establishing technical charter isn't about imposing rules – it's about creating conditions where teams can do their best work. My experience as a manager taught me that regular engagement, varied facilitation techniques, efficient meetings, and trusting people to own their solutions builds teams that deliver consistently.
