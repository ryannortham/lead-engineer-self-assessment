## Forming new teams and establishing ways of working

New teams need to get through the forming and storming phases before they can
deliver effectively. I run discussions early to agree on how we want to
work together: communication preferences, meeting cadences, and the agile
processes that make sense for that specific engagement. Getting this right
early creates shared understanding and psychological safety from the start.

## Keeping standups focused

Standups can easily drift into long discussions, frustrating people who just
want to get on with their work.

I'm confident enough to speak up and encourage the team to stay on track. When I
notice things going off topic, I'll gently steer us back to the core format:
what I did, what I'm doing, blockers. I encourage parking deeper discussions for
afterwards, where interested people can stay. I model this by keeping my own
updates short.

This keeps standups efficient. People appreciate having their time respected
while still having space for important conversations.

## Building team culture through regular engagement

As QA Manager and Platform Lead, I was responsible for creating an environment
where team members felt supported and could raise issues without fear.

I ran regular 1:1s with each team member to discuss career progression, work
through problems, and give them space to raise concerns. Held team meetings with
project updates, shoutouts, and knowledge sharing. Made myself available and
approachable.

Team members raised issues early rather than hiding problems. We built a culture
where people looked out for each other.

## Facilitating retrospectives that lead to action

It's easy for retros to become venting sessions where the team forgets to think
about how to improve things. I make sure we come up with concrete action items
with delegated ownership, and that we revisit progress on these in subsequent
retros.

I also vary the format to keep sessions fresh and draw out different
perspectives. Picking the right format based on what's happened that sprint
helps quieter team members contribute in ways that suit them.

## Letting team members own their solutions

When delegating, it's tempting to prescribe exactly how something should be
done, especially when you already have an approach in mind.

I've learned to step back and let people propose their own solutions, even when
different from what I would do. I'll point out risks I can see, but leave the
final decision with them. I trust that they'll learn and iterate if the first
attempt doesn't work.

This gives team members real ownership over their work rather than just following
instructions. It often produces better outcomes than the approach I had in mind.
When things don't work out, we learn together.
