# Lead Software Engineer Self-Assessment

**Ryan Northam**  
Senior Software Engineer → Lead Software Engineer

## Overview

After 4.5 years at Mantel and over a decade in software delivery, I'm consistently operating at Lead level – owning technical direction, building stakeholder trust, and enabling teams to deliver.

Unlike most Senior Engineers applying for Lead, I bring actual leadership experience from previous roles as QA Manager and Platform Lead, where I built teams, managed performance, and delegated effectively. This experience, combined with my technical depth and delivery track record at Mantel, positions me to step into the Lead Engineer role.

This self-assessment documents my evidence against the five Lead Engineer responsibilities.

## What Sets Me Apart

- **Actual leadership experience** – QA Manager, Platform Lead roles before Mantel
- **Team management** – built teams, managed performance, developed talent
- **Effective delegation** – context, tools, timelines, expected results
- **Scrum Master experience** – getting teams working together effectively
- **Product Owner experience** – working with business, organising backlogs
- **Technical depth** – Golang, AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, full-stack, AI/ML

I'm not learning to lead for the first time – I'm bringing proven leadership skills into a Lead Engineer context.
