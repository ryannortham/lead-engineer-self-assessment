## Overview

After 4.5 years at Mantel and over a decade in software delivery, I've consistently worked in roles that combine technical depth with team leadership.

Before joining Mantel, I held QA Manager and Platform Lead positions where I built teams, managed performance, and learned to delegate effectively. I've also worked as Scrum Master and Product Owner, translating business needs into deliverables.

At Mantel, I've continued to operate in a leadership capacity: owning technical direction, building stakeholder trust, and enabling teams to deliver. This self-assessment documents my evidence against the five Lead Engineer responsibilities.
