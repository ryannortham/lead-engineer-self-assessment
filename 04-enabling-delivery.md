## Evidence

### Led platform strategy and backlog creation at Fred (Platform Lead)

**Context:** As Platform Lead at Fred, the business deployed infrastructure via ad-hoc click-ops which wasn't scalable. There was no clear platform strategy or roadmap.

**What I did:** Worked with the business to create a strategy for uplifting the company's platform capabilities. Created and prioritised features, got buy-in from stakeholders, and broke features into actionable work items with the team during backlog refinement sessions.

**Outcome:** The team implemented infrastructure-as-code using Terraform, built a release management suite, and implemented observability using Datadog and PowerBI. Moved from ad-hoc manual deployments to a scalable, repeatable platform.

**Leadership demonstrated:** Translated business needs into a technical roadmap, built stakeholder alignment, and enabled the team to execute against a clear backlog.

### Refined backlog into deliverable work at Entain

**Context:** Once the Entain API refactoring team was formed, we were allocated a Product Owner who prioritised new features. However, business priorities needed to be translated into work the development team could pick up and deliver.

**What I did:** Worked with the team to refine the backlog into deliverable user stories. Broke down feature areas including logging/tracing/observability uplift, performance improvements, OpenAPI documentation, and additional API endpoints exposing new racing data functionality.

**Outcome:** Developers had clarity on what to build and why. Work was sized appropriately, with clear acceptance criteria. The team could focus on delivery rather than constantly seeking clarification.

### Invested in self-service tooling to unblock delivery at NAB

**Context:** At NAB, AI initiatives were blocked waiting for the platform team to provision infrastructure and configure deployments. This bottleneck slowed adoption across the organisation.

**What I did:** Designed a self-service framework so teams could build and deploy Bedrock AgentCore applications independently. Created opinionated templates, schema-validated configuration, and automated pipelines that handled the full deployment lifecycle.

**Outcome:** Eliminated the platform team as a bottleneck. Teams could self-serve, significantly reducing setup time for new AI initiatives. The investment in tooling paid dividends across the organisation.

### Drove quality improvements to enable sustainable delivery at Entain

**Context:** The legacy Entain API had no tests. Any changes risked introducing regressions, which slowed delivery and reduced confidence.

**What I did:** Championed a quality-first approach during the refactoring. Introduced dependency injection to make the codebase testable. Established testing patterns and worked with the team to build coverage systematically.

**Outcome:** Unit test coverage increased from 0% to 75%. The team could make changes with confidence, accelerating delivery rather than slowing it down.

### Enabled efficient development through observability at Entain

**Context:** Without visibility into system behaviour, debugging issues was time-consuming and developers lacked insight into performance characteristics.

**What I did:** Set up observability dashboards using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Tempo. Gave the team visibility into metrics, logs, and traces in one place.

**Outcome:** Developers could diagnose issues quickly. Performance problems were identified and resolved before impacting users. The investment in observability made ongoing development more efficient.

## Summary

Enabling delivery is about creating conditions for the team to succeed – building clear backlogs, investing in tooling that removes friction, and driving quality improvements that build confidence. My experience as a Product Owner and Platform Lead taught me how to translate business needs into actionable work and how to invest in capabilities that pay dividends over time.
