# 5. Scaling Through Delegation

> A Lead is accountable for the solution but responsibility should be shared with the team. Leads must leverage others' expertise, create shared standards, and ensure the project can continue if they're unavailable.

## Evidence

### Developed a delegation approach as QA Manager and Platform Lead

In previous leadership roles, I was accountable for team outcomes but couldn't do everything myself. I had to learn to delegate effectively.

Over time I developed an approach that worked:
- **Context** — explain why the work matters and how it fits the bigger picture
- **Tools** — make sure people have access to what they need
- **Timelines** — set realistic expectations with input from the team
- **Expected results** — be clear about what success looks like

This gave team members autonomy within clear boundaries. They developed their skills and delivered quality work without constant oversight. The team could operate when I wasn't around.

### Onboarded and enabled team at Entain

After the successful API assessment, three additional Mantel developers joined to complete the refactoring. These were experienced leads who didn't need micromanagement.

I gave them an overview of the codebase and the lay of the land: project goals, key stakeholders, onboarding logistics, and technical context. Gave them what they needed to be effective, then got out of the way.

The team was productive quickly. Each developer brought their own expertise and approach. The refactoring was completed successfully with shared ownership across the team.

### Highlighted risks but let people decide

When delegating, I've learned to resist the urge to prescribe exactly how something should be done.

If I see risks with someone's proposed approach, I'll point them out. But I leave the final decision with them. If they want to try something different from what I would do, that's fine. They'll learn from it either way, and often they come back with something better than I'd expected.

This connects to what I wrote about in [Technical Charter](02-technical-charter.md) — the goal is for team members to feel ownership over their work, not just follow instructions.

### Built systems that don't depend on individuals

At NAB, I designed the AI self-service framework specifically so teams wouldn't depend on me or the platform team. The templates, documentation, and automated pipelines mean anyone can spin up new applications without hand-holding. (More detail in [Enabling Delivery](04-enabling-delivery.md).)

At Entain, I retrofitted OpenAPI documentation so the API was self-describing. Established testing patterns and coding conventions. Created a codebase that could be understood and extended by future developers, not just the original authors.

Reducing dependency on individuals is a core part of scaling through delegation.

### People Guide at Mantel

Building on my experience managing and mentoring team members, I've taken on a People Guide role at Mantel. This involves supporting guidees through career development and being a sounding board for challenges they face. It's a natural extension of the mentoring I've done throughout my career.

## Summary

Effective delegation isn't about offloading work. It's about enabling others to succeed. Providing context, trusting people to find their own solutions, and building systems that don't depend on any single individual. My management experience taught me these skills, and I continue to apply them at Mantel.
