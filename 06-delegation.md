# 5. Scaling Through Delegation

> A Lead is accountable for the solution but responsibility should be shared with the team. Leads must leverage others' expertise, create shared standards, and ensure the project can continue if they're unavailable.

## Evidence

### Delegated effectively as QA Manager and Platform Lead

**Context:** In previous leadership roles, I was accountable for team outcomes but couldn't do all the work myself. I had to delegate effectively to scale.

**How I delegated:**
- **Context** – explained why the work mattered and how it fit the bigger picture
- **Tools** – ensured the right tools and access were available
- **Timelines** – set realistic timelines with input from the team
- **Expected results** – defined what success looked like so there was no ambiguity

**Outcome:** Team members had autonomy within clear boundaries. They developed their skills and delivered quality work without needing constant oversight. The team could operate when I wasn't available.

### Onboarded and enabled team at Entain

**Context:** After the successful API assessment, a team of three additional Mantel developers joined to complete the refactoring work. These were experienced leads who didn't need micromanagement.

**What I did:** Provided an overview of the existing codebase and the lay of the land – project goals, key stakeholders, onboarding logistics, and technical context. Gave them what they needed to be effective rather than prescribing how to work.

**Outcome:** The team was productive quickly. Each developer brought their own expertise and approach. The refactoring was completed successfully with shared ownership across the team.

### Trusted team members to own their solutions

**Context:** When delegating work, it's tempting to prescribe exactly how something should be done – especially when you have a clear idea of the approach.

**What I learned:** More often than not, team members come up with solutions different from how I would approach the problem. Initial reaction is to redirect them to do it my way.

**What I do instead:** Highlight any risks I see with their approach, but ultimately leave the decision with them. Trust that they will learn and iterate if the first attempt doesn't work out.

**Outcome:** Team members feel ownership over their work rather than just following instructions. More often than not, they come back with solutions better than I would have expected. When things don't work out, we learn together.

### Created self-service capabilities to reduce dependency at NAB

**Context:** At NAB, AI initiatives were dependent on the platform team for provisioning and configuration. This created a bottleneck and single point of failure.

**What I did:** Designed a self-service framework with opinionated templates, schema-validated configuration, and automated pipelines. Documented conventions so teams could operate independently.

**Outcome:** Teams no longer depended on me or the platform team to deploy. Knowledge wasn't siloed – anyone with access to the templates and documentation could spin up new AI applications.

---

### Created shared standards and documentation at Entain

**Context:** The legacy API had no documentation. Knowledge was siloed in people who had since left.

**What I did:** Retrofitted OpenAPI documentation so the API was self-describing. Established testing patterns and coding conventions that the team adopted. Created a codebase that could be understood and extended by anyone, not just the original authors.

**Outcome:** Reduced dependency on individuals. Future developers could onboard and contribute without extensive hand-holding.

### People Guide at Mantel

Building on prior experience managing and mentoring team members, I've taken on a People Guide role at Mantel. This involves supporting guidees through their career development and being a sounding board for challenges they face.

## Summary

Effective delegation isn't about offloading work – it's about enabling others to succeed. My management experience taught me how to provide the right context, trust people to find their own solutions, and create systems that don't depend on any single individual. These are essential skills for a Lead Engineer.
