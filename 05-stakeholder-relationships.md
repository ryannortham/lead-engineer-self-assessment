# 4. Building Stakeholder Relationships

> Building relationships that exist beyond day-to-day interactions. Measures of success include being trusted to make decisions, being sought for opinions, being offered new business, and providing unique insights.

## Evidence

### Sought out as subject matter expert on AWS Bedrock AgentCore

After the Wesfarmers engagement, I'd developed solid experience with AWS Bedrock AgentCore and Strands Agents, which is still fairly new technology with limited expertise across the industry.

Another team within Mantel reached out to me for advice on their project using the same technology. They wanted to understand capabilities, limitations, and practical implementation patterns.

I was able to share what I'd learned and help them avoid pitfalls I'd encountered. It felt good to be the go-to person for something I'd invested time in learning.

### Invited to present at AWS Melbourne offices

The Wesfarmers engagement was sponsored by AWS, who recommended Mantel based on an existing relationship. We worked closely with AWS Professional Services and Wesfarmers throughout.

Both AWS and Wesfarmers were happy with what we delivered. I was invited back to present the agentic canvas creation Slack bot to the broader Wesfarmers group at the AWS offices in Melbourne.

This extended the relationship beyond the immediate project and put Mantel in front of a wider audience within the client organisation.

### Built lasting relationship at Entain

At Entain, I worked closely with the development manager throughout the TAB NZ terminals migration.

We formed a strong working relationship through consistent delivery and open communication. After successful project completion, Entain invited our Mantel team to their celebration dinner in Brisbane. They flew us up to meet their team, work from their office, and celebrate together.

This went beyond a typical client-vendor relationship. The invitation reflected genuine appreciation and the connections we'd built during the engagement.

### Presented project outcomes to Mantel Digital

After the Entain project, there was interest within Mantel Digital about our approach and lessons learned.

I presented to the Mantel Digital group, explaining the project approach, challenges we faced, and what worked. Shared what we'd do differently next time.

This helped other teams learn from our experience and apply relevant patterns to their own work.

### Earned contract extension through delivery at Entain

Mantel's initial engagement at Entain focused on the API uplift. The client was uncertain whether the legacy system could be salvaged.

After demonstrating that the API could be refactored successfully and delivering on our commitment, the client extended the contract to include the TAB NZ migration. This was a significantly larger piece of work.

The extension came from trusted delivery. The client chose to expand the relationship rather than look elsewhere.

## Summary

Stakeholder relationships aren't built through grand gestures. They're built through consistent, trusted delivery and genuine engagement. Being sought for expertise, invited to present to broader audiences, building real connections with clients, sharing knowledge with peers, and earning contract extensions through delivery all demonstrate this.
