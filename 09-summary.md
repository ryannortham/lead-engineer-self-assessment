# Summary

## Why I'm Ready

After 4.5 years at Mantel and over a decade in software delivery, I'm consistently operating at Lead level. This self-assessment documents evidence across all five Lead Engineer responsibilities:

| Responsibility | Key Evidence |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Technical Charter** | Built team culture through regular engagement; facilitated retrospectives; kept standups focused; let team members own their solutions |
| **Architecture** | Assessed options and recommended approach at Entain; designed enterprise AI framework at NAB; presented architecture at Wesfarmers; created documentation standards |
| **Enabling Delivery** | Led platform strategy and backlog creation; refined work into deliverable stories; built self-service tooling at NAB; drove quality improvements at Entain |
| **Stakeholder Relationships** | Sought as SME on Bedrock AgentCore; invited to present at AWS Melbourne; built lasting client relationships at Entain; earned contract extension through delivery |
| **Delegation** | Developed delegation approach in management roles; onboarded and enabled teams; highlighted risks but let people decide; built systems that don't depend on individuals |

## What I Bring

Before Mantel, I held QA Manager and Platform Lead roles where I:
- Built and managed teams
- Handled performance management and talent development
- Learned to delegate effectively: context, tools, timelines, expected results
- Ran retrospectives and standups as Scrum Master
- Worked as Product Owner, translating business needs into deliverables

This isn't the first time I've been in a leadership position. The skills I developed in those roles transfer directly to the Lead Engineer context.

## Conclusion

The Lead Engineer role is about shaping and delivering project outcomes rather than solving specific problems within an engagement. My experience shows this:

- At **Entain**, I assessed the legacy API, recommended an approach, gained stakeholder buy-in, and enabled a team to execute successfully. The relationship grew into a contract extension.
- At **NAB**, I designed a framework that lets teams self-serve without waiting on the platform team.
- At **Wesfarmers**, I delivered a solution that impressed both AWS and the client, leading to invitations to present to broader audiences.

Throughout my career, I've built teams, managed performance, and focused on enabling others to succeed. I'm ready for Lead Engineer.
