# Summary

> Why I'm ready for Lead Engineer.

## Evidence at a Glance

After 4.5 years at Mantel and over a decade in software delivery, I'm
consistently operating at Lead level. This self-assessment documents evidence
across all five Lead Engineer responsibilities:

| Responsibility | Key Evidence |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Technical Charter** | Built team culture through regular engagement; facilitated retrospectives; kept standups focused; let team members own their solutions |
| **Architecture** | Assessed options and recommended approach at Entain; designed enterprise AI framework at NAB; presented architecture at Wesfarmers; created documentation standards |
| **Enabling Delivery** | Led platform strategy and backlog creation; refined work into deliverable stories; built self-service tooling at NAB; drove quality improvements at Entain |
| **Stakeholder Relationships** | Sought as SME on Bedrock AgentCore; invited to present at AWS Melbourne; built lasting client relationships at Entain; earned contract extension through delivery |
| **Delegation** | Developed delegation approach in management roles; onboarded and enabled teams; highlighted risks but let people decide; built systems that don't depend on individuals |

## What I Bring

At Mantel, I've consistently shaped technical direction, enabled teams to
deliver, and built lasting stakeholder relationships. That's shown up in
concrete outcomes: a contract extension at Entain, a self-service AI framework
at NAB, and an ongoing relationship with AWS and Wesfarmers off the back of a
successful engagement. I also came in with prior leadership experience —
managing teams, handling performance reviews, and owning delivery as a Product
Owner and Scrum Master — so these aren't skills I'm developing for the first
time.

The thread through all of it is the same: I focus on enabling others to
succeed, and I take ownership of outcomes beyond just the code. I'm ready for
Lead Engineer.
