# Summary

## Why I'm Ready

After 4.5 years at Mantel and over a decade in software delivery, I'm consistently operating at Lead level. This self-assessment has documented evidence across all five Lead Engineer responsibilities:

| Responsibility | Key Evidence |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Technical Charter** | Built team culture through regular engagement; facilitated retrospectives; guided effective standups; empowered team members to own solutions |
| **Architecture** | Assessed options and recommended approaches at Entain; designed enterprise AI framework at NAB; presented architecture at Wesfarmers; created documentation standards |
| **Enabling Delivery** | Led platform strategy and backlog creation; refined work into deliverable stories; invested in self-service tooling; drove quality improvements |
| **Stakeholder Relationships** | Sought as SME on Bedrock AgentCore; invited to present at AWS Melbourne; built lasting client relationships; earned contract extensions through delivery |
| **Delegation** | Delegated effectively in management roles; onboarded and enabled teams; trusted team members to own solutions; created self-service capabilities to reduce dependency |

## What Sets Me Apart

Unlike most Senior Engineers applying for Lead, I bring:

- **Actual leadership experience** – QA Manager and Platform Lead roles before Mantel
- **Team management** – built teams, managed performance, developed talent
- **Effective delegation** – context, tools, timelines, expected results
- **Scrum Master experience** – getting teams working together effectively
- **Product Owner experience** – working with business, organising backlogs into deliverables

I'm not learning to lead for the first time – I'm bringing proven leadership skills into a Lead Engineer context.

## Technical Depth

Across my engagements, I've developed expertise in:

- **Languages:** Golang, TypeScript, Python
- **Cloud:** AWS (Bedrock, Lambda, ECS), GCP (Cloud Functions, Cloud Build, GKE)
- **Platforms:** GitHub, Jenkins, Terraform, Kubernetes
- **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo
- **AI/ML:** AWS Bedrock, AgentCore, Strands Agents
- **Full-Stack:** Vue.js, REST APIs, gRPC/protobuf

## Conclusion

The Lead Engineer role focuses on shaping and delivering project outcomes rather than solving specific problems within an engagement. My experience demonstrates this consistently:

- At **Entain**, I assessed the legacy API, recommended an approach, gained stakeholder buy-in, and enabled a team to execute successfully
- At **NAB**, I designed a framework that eliminated bottlenecks and enabled teams to self-serve
- At **Wesfarmers**, I delivered a solution that impressed both AWS and the client, leading to invitations to present to broader audiences
- Throughout my career, I've built teams, managed performance, and created conditions for others to succeed

I'm ready for Lead Engineer.
