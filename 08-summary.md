# Summary

> Why I'm ready for Lead Engineer.

At Mantel, I've consistently shaped technical direction, enabled teams to
deliver, and built lasting stakeholder relationships. That's shown up in
concrete outcomes: a contract extension at Entain, a self-service AI framework
at NAB, real-time reporting that gave ANZ visibility into a high-stakes
migration, and an ongoing relationship with AWS and Wesfarmers off the back of
a successful engagement.

I also came in with prior leadership experience (managing teams, handling
performance reviews, and owning delivery as a Product Owner and Scrum Master),
so these aren't skills I'm developing for the first time.

The thread through all of it is the same: I focus on enabling others to succeed,
and I take ownership of outcomes beyond just the code. I'm ready for Lead
Engineer.
